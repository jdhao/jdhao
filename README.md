I am an algorithm engineer who is passionate about working with computer vision.
I have been working on various projects, ranging from image retrieval, OCR, document analysis and reconstruction,
to video fingerprinting/deduplication.
I am also a Vim/Nvim enthusiast, [sharing tips and tricks on using Neovim](https://jdhao.github.io/categories/Nvim/).
