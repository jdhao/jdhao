I am an algorithm engineer who is passionate about working with computer vision.
I am experienced in image processing using [OpenCV](https://jdhao.github.io/tags/OpenCV/) and [PIL](https://jdhao.github.io/tags/PIL/), and also in data visualization using [Matplotlib](https://jdhao.github.io/tags/Matplotlib/).
I have been working on various vision-related projects, ranging from image retrieval, OCR, document image analysis and reconstruction,
to video fingerprinting/deduplication.

I am also a FOSS lover and a Vim/Nvim enthusiast in particular, [sharing tips and tricks on using Neovim](https://jdhao.github.io/categories/Nvim/).
More info can be found on my website: https://jdhao.github.io/about.
